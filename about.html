                        <h2>It all started with a friend's challenge...</h2>
                        <p>That simple question—"Why don't you build your own watch?"—sparked an unexpected journey. From crafting my very first custom timepiece at a small workbench, I discovered a deep passion for design, precision, and the art of storytelling through watches. Today, Ethan & Isaac Customs exists to reinvent the custom watch experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3>More Than Customization. Creation.</h3>
                        <p>We're not just changing straps or engraving initials—we're building watches from the ground up, piece by piece, inspired by <strong>you</strong>. Whether you know exactly what you want or are just starting to explore ideas, we'll guide you through every step. From selecting components to fine-tuning the smallest details, we work together until your watch feels like a true extension of who you are.</p>
